Render GUI for tools and games, general goals:
- tweakbar-like property lists
- node based designes
- animation/effect possibilities
- fast

Special decisions:
- Draw order guarantees: between layers, GPU-given one between sprites
- Caching: OPEN DECISION//No textures, No Batching over frames (might come if not fast enough)
  - for now prototype the simplest possible solution!
- Clipping: use Scissor (because text is difficult otherwise) -> clip only for components where necessary
- Coordinates: start at the lower-left (0,0) and have unit pixels, RefFrame & ClippingAreas include the left/bottom and exclude the right/top pixels
